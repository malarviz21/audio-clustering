•Developed an unsupervised learning pipeline to cluster animal sounds from the ESC-50 dataset using Autoencoders and advanced feature extraction (MFCC, Mel-Spectrograms).

•Implemented and optimized clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN, GMM), improving clustering accuracy by 40-60% with latent space representations.

•Evaluated model performance using confusion matrices, Adjusted Rand Index, and t-SNE visualization, leading to better feature separation.
